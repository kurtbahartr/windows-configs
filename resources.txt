Download: https://www.myabandonware.com/game/blur-gls#download

Download ONLY v1.0! See below as to why:

  There's a community-run server called Amax to keep online features of Blur alive.
  See https://amax-emu.com/How_to_play for more info.

If you can, you're advised to limit the game's framerate to 60 FPS since anything higher will greatly break the way it's rendered.
NVIDIA GPU users can do this either within NVIDIA Control Panel or the NVIDIA App;

  Control Panel: Manage 3D Settings > Program Settings > Blur.exe (Select a program to customise) > Max Frame Rate (Specify the settings for this program) > On (60)
  NVIDIA App: Graphics > ADD A PROGRAM > C:\Program Files (x86)\Activision\Blur\Blur.exe > Max Frame Rate > On (60)

Linux users can also pull off something similar using libstrangle: https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/libstrangle-git

EZCast Lite
-----------
This software is meant to make use of the additional functionality provided in Miracast devices like Anycast, such as YouTube playback and receiver-level volume control.

It also provides faster connection in comparison to the regular built-in Miracast protocol (The "Cast" tile).

Windows Media Center
--------------------
Microsoft removed support for Windows Media Center and Windows DVD Player long ago, but there's a 3rd party port to get it fully working on the latest and greatest versions of Windows.

Encoding password for use in the answer file
--------------------------------------------
You can use and read the code in "encode-for-autounattend.sh" to accomplish this.

Display name for use in the answer file
---------------------------------------
/unattend/settings[pass="oobeSystem"]/component[name="Microsoft-Windows-Shell-Setup"]/UserAccounts/LocalAccounts/LocalAccount[wcm:action="add"]/DisplayName

The "Name" key impacts the username whereas "DisplayName" is what you see in the GUI.
