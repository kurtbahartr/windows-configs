Windows Subsystem for Linux/Android
-----------------------------------
Since my autounattend disables Hyper-V as a boot parameter, the system will refuse to launch Hyper-V virtual machines even if you explicitly enable the feature.
Furthermore, enabling this after installing VMware Workstation might cause problems related to VM performance and warnings related to Side Channel Mitigation.
If you can, go for a full-blown Linux VM. If you can't or aren't willing to, run the following command as administrator and reboot;

  bcdedit /set hypervisorlaunchtype auto

Once that's done, either install WSL using "wsl --install" or WSA from WSABuilds GitHub repo.

Dualbooting with Linux/ChromeOS/macOS
-------------------------------------
Unless you install Arch with "hwclock --hctosys" or use Pisi Linux, it's very unlikely for a non-NT kernel to cooperate with how Windows handles hardware clock.
The simplest solution is to tell Windows to cooperate instead and have it do this the Linux way;

  HKLM\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\TimeZoneInformation
    RealTimeIsUniversal[DWORD]=1

Follow this by a reboot and resync your time on either of the OSes.

Hosts entry for GSBWIFI
-----------------------
wifi.gsb.gov.tr is resolved in a local DNS server with the domain name kykwifi.com and the login page itself is also local to the dormitory.
This situation makes usage of a VPN such as WireGuard an unviable solution because a VPN typically changes your DNS server, which means the domain will no longer work.
The following is the hosts entry you should put into C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts as an administrator to get this resolved.

  10.106.7.45 wifi.gsb.gov.tr

The IP address may vary depending on the exact dormitory. You should try pinging the address and see what IP it resolves to.
This immediately takes effect after saving the file, but just to play it safe, you may want to do;

  ipconfig /flushdns

Certificate for GSBWIFI
-----------------------
If you don't want to use VPN and are content with having to cope with the narrow-as-hell bandwidth your dormitory's WiFi offers, you WILL have to install its certificate.
Visit wifi.gsb.gov.tr and switch to Turkish to obtain the "GSB Drive" link for the certificate.
Install the certificate into the "Trusted Certificate Authorities" store of the Local Machine.
Once that's done, either restart your system or relaunch your browser.

Connecting to eduroam
---------------------
Universities tend to offer different methods to connect to eduroam, but Windows has become smart enough to understand the security type a given enterprise network uses.
If clicking Connect on the network and entering your university credentials doesn't work or if you need a certificate you can only obtain with CAT, visit:

  https://cat.eduroam.org/

QoL tweaks for StartAllBack
---------------------------
- Start Menu
  - Disable the master toggle

- Taskbar
  - Enable "Centered task icons", keep the mode at default

- Tray icons
  - Enable "Quick settings" (between the input indicator and clock)

- Explorer
  - Use "Win11 Command Bar" for stock cmdbar, "Win10 Ribbon UI" for something more performant and that feels more right.
  - You may disable "Classic context menus" if you want the modern context menu, though the classic one is already redesigned by SAB to look more consistent and perform faster.
  - Enable "Colorize everything with accent color"

- Advanced
  - Enable "Use new font for classic UI"

Enable Magic category in StartAllBack
-------------------------------------
This will make even more under-the-hood tweaks to visual style and may require you to log out for this to work properly.

  StartAllBackCfg.exe /Magic

Then enable the master toggle and log out.

Remap Menu key to act as Right CTRL
-----------------------------------
Some gaming laptops omit the right CTRL keys on non-English layouts, such as Turkish Q, in favor of keys like "<" instead of omitting the menu key instead.
You can use PowerToys's Keyboard Manager utility to remap the menu key.
One side effect to this will be that some programs will still recognize the menu key and treat it as one upon key release event.

  Source key: Apps/Menu
  Target keybind: RCTRL+(None)

PowerToys will give out a warning that the source key isn't bound to anything yet. Just confirm that. No reboot required.

Enable sudo command on Windows 11 v23H2 and higher
--------------------------------------------------
Settings > System > For developers > Enable sudo

You may also want to expand the option to configure sudo to run inline just like in Linux. The default is in a new window.

Enable end task option on taskbar icon right click on Windows 11 v22H2 and higher
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Settings > System > For developers > End Task

Enable the option to hibernate
------------------------------
Control Panel (control.exe) > Power Options > Choose what the power buttons do > Change settings that are currently unavailable > Hibernate (Tick this) > Save changes

If the option for "Hibernate" doesn't appear, try running this command as an admin;

  powercfg -h on

No need to follow that by a reboot. This change takes effect immediately.
